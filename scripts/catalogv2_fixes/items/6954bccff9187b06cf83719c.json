    "prompt": "Complete the code for the class Truck. The class must be able to enable the creation of new objects of type Truck by means of:- passing no args (default constructor), so you have to define default values for the five defined attributes of the class (model, year, color, maxCapacity and currentLoad).- passing all the five attributes defined in the class as args (full constructor). You also have to implement all the accessor and mutator (get/set) methods for each of these 5 attributes. Finally, you have to implement the methods load and unload for modifying the currentLoad attribute as needed (validating that currentLoad cannot be lower than zero when unloading and cannot be greater than maxCapacity when loading). More instructions on how to implement the missing parts of this class are provided in the code below.",
