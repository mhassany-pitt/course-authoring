    "prompt": "You are a cook in a busy restaurant.  You are writing a program to help you organize how much of each kind of food you need to cook.  Naturally, you decide to take a break from cooking and write a function to help.  You decide that your function will take a dictionary as a parameter where the keys are the tables in the restaurant and the values are lists of strings describing the food each table has ordered.  Your function returns a dictionary with the totals for how many of each food item you need to cook.For example, say you have 5 tables and 3 dishes:Tables: t1, t2, t3, t4 and t5Dishes: Vegetarian stew, Steak pie, PoutineInput:You will use the table names as the keys, and use a list of the foods ordered at each table as values.For example your dictionary may look like this:{'t1': ['Vegetarian stew', 'Poutine', 'Vegetarian stew'],  't3': ['Steak pie', 'Poutine', 'Vegetarian stew'],  't4': ['Steak pie', 'Steak pie']}Output:Your function must return a dictionary with the dish as the key, and the number of times that dish was ordered as the value.  Given the above input, your function would create and return a dictionary equivalent to the following:{'Vegetarian stew': 3, 'Poutine': 2, 'Steak pie': 3}Here we have started the code for you.  Complete it:",
