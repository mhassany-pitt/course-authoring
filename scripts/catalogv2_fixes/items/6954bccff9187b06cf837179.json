Like other employees in the company, the employees at the customer service call center are paid based on the hours that they work. If they work over 40 hours in a week, the payment amount should take into account the overtime hours. The overtime hours are paid at a rate one and a half times the regular pay rate.\\nThe company's policy is to pay more to those employees at the customer service call center who work during weekends. Therefore, the minimum extra pay that the employees could receive for each day of work during weekends is $30. The extra pay increases to the maximum of $50 for the employees who have at least 5 days of work during weekends.",
