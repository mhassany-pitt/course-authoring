A product code includes, among other information, a character in the tenth position that represents the zone from which that product was made, and a four-digit integer representing the district in which it will be sold. This four-digit integer begins at the 4th character and extends to the 7th character in the input code (inclusive). Due to some reorganization, products from zone R are banned from being sold in districts with a designation of 2000 or higher.\\nConstruct a program that reads product codes from the user and counts the number of valid and banned codes entered. Make sure that the program handles all possible exceptions.\\nThe program must ask the user for an input until the user enters STOP.",
